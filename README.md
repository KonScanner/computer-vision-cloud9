# computer-vision-cloud9
A computer vision example using `AWS Rekognition`, `boto3` and `click`. Written and tested in a cloud9 instance, but should be usable from anyones home machine.

## Usability
- In order to use it:
  - You must <u>either</u> be on an AWS instance, or have your aws cli configuration prepared on your machine.
    - More about configuration on your own machine here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html
- Then all you need to do is:
  - `source \venv\bin\activate`
  - `python3 detector.py --help`
    - The --help command gives you enough instructions on how it can be used.
